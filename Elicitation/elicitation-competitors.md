# Request for Participation in Short Survey for Academic Project

Hi,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is André Roxhage, and I am an engineering student and enrolled in the ETSN15 Requirements Engineering course at Lund University. As part of a project for this course, my team and I are developing a conceptual travel planning tool called EasyTrip, designed to enhance the way users compare and explore flight options.

To better understand user needs and expectations, we are reaching out to industry professionals and travelers for their input. We would appreciate it if someone from your team could take a few moments to answer a brief set of questions. Your insights will help us refine the requirements for our concept.

The questions are short and can be answered directly by replying to this email. However, if you have the possibility, we'd like to have a more in-depth meeting, to further investigate your needs as a stakeholder.

Here are some sample questions we would like to ask:

- What are the most common challanges you encounter when sourcing real-time flight data from airline APIs?
- How do you handle situations such as sudden price changes or availabilty issues?
- How do you evaluate and add new airlines / travel agencies as data sources?
- Have you noticed any new trends in user behavior or preferences that influence how your platform developed?
- How do you ensure that the pricing models and commision structures are both competitive and satisfying for both airlines and travellers?
- Anything else you'd like to add?

We would be happy to provide the complete list of questions upon your acceptance of this request.

If you are available to assist, please let us know. Your contributions will be acknowledged as part of our academic project, and any feedback will remain confidential and used strictly for educational purposes.

Thank you for considering our request. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need more information.

Best regards,  
André Roxhage
