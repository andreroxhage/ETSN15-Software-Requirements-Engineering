# **1. Can you tell us a little about yourself? (e.g., occupation, travel frequency, digital habits)**

My name is Sofia. I'm a 24-year-old medical student who lives in Lund, originally from there as well. So I didn’t travel far. I actually traveled for four months in Southeast Asia with my boyfriend. It was an amazing experience, and we used some flight apps that may be quite similar to what you are interested in making.


# **2. How often do you travel by air, and for what purposes (e.g., business, family visits, holiday)?**

I only travel by air for holidays, and one time I traveled for work to attend a conference. If it's very far away, then I take a flight. If it's in Sweden, Norway, or a nearby country, then I often take the train or car. I would say I travel about one or two times every year. But when I was traveling with my boyfriend for four months, we flew about seven times. So it depends, but usually around one to two times a year.

# **3. What tools or services do you currently use to book flights?**

I use Momondo, Skyscanner, and sometimes an Hopper. 

# **4. Can you shortly describe your usual process when planning a trip?**
If I find a good price with Norwegian, for example, I go to Norwegian’s website to book it directly. It feels safer that way.

# **5. What are the biggest challenges you face when searching for flights?**

Sometimes, I don’t have to travel on an exact date, but searching for multiple dates is a hassle. I have to manually check different days, which takes time. If I know I want to travel to Scotland for about a week but don’t have to leave on a specific day, it would be nice if an app suggested the best day based on price. It doesn’t even have to be a fixed date; just a range, like "I want to travel for a week, give or take three days, starting around this time."

# **6. How do you know where to travel when deciding for a holiday?**

Most often, I already have a place in mind—something I’ve heard about or seen. But sometimes, I look at a specific airline and check which destination has the lowest price. If the price difference is huge, I may go for the cheaper option. But if the prices don’t vary much, I choose based on destination. If something is very expensive, I postpone it for later.

# **7. How important is the price of the transportation when deciding where to go? (on a scale [0,10])**

That’s hard to say. Sometimes I know I want to go somewhere and will pay a lot for it. Other times, I look at prices for inspiration, which opens my mind to different destinations. If I see a cheap flight to Slovenia, for example, I might consider going. I’d say around 4. It’s a factor, but not the most important.

# **8. Are there any methods for finding cheap destinations?**

I use Momondo or Skyscanner and sort by the cheapest flight. But it’s also important that there aren’t too many layovers.

# **9. Which flight comparison websites or apps have you used? (e.g., Momondo, Google Flights, Skyscanner)**

They’re quite similar. What I like is that Momondo and Hopper show a visual representation of price trends. You can see a curve of how prices change over time. Hopper also predicts if prices will increase or decrease and sends notifications.

# **10. What do you like and dislike about these platforms?**
Like: Answered before
Disliked: Not really, but one issue is that you have to book with different airlines separately. It’s nice that they combine different flights, but you have to book them individually, which is an extra step.

# **11. Have you ever encountered any frustrating experiences while booking a flight online?**

Yes, sometimes flights get sold out while I’m filling out the form. Also, on some older websites, if you go back to change something, the information disappears, which is annoying.

# **12. How important are factors like price, departure time, layovers, and airline reputation when choosing a flight?**

Airline reputation isn’t that important to me because I feel like negative reviews are often from frustrated travelers who missed their flight. Departure time matters, but the total travel duration is more important.

# **13. Do you ever use filters when searching for a trip? Do you usually enable notifications on price drops or similar features?**

Yeah, sometimes I check only direct flights. I don't know if it's that is actually a box, but if I would suggest it, if it's not to have, like a box, or I only want to use the same airline, if it's a labor, I guess that is that exists, but I haven't seen it,

# **14. Do you usually book flights immediately after finding a good price, or do you monitor prices over time?**

I monitor them, yeah. But if it's like, if I'm very close to the Destiny departure date, then I can book it like the same day. Do

# **15. Do you find current flight comparison interfaces easy to use? Why or why not?**

Yeah, I think hopper is a bit cleaner, is a bit more modern, modern and easier to use. Both are very easy. I would say both are easy, but, but hoppers may be cleaner in the appearance


# **16. What kind of visual elements help you understand and compare flights more effectively?**

Yeah, I really like the graph. It's like a horizontal, horizontal line with each date, and you can see like, like a book diagram. I don't know if it's called like, but you can see like, stop a little girl, how the price changes throughout the dates. I feel like that's a really good visual way of demonstrating the price change. Okay, yeah, perfect.

# **17. Is there anything else you would like to add about your experience with travel planning?**

Uh, yeah, I have one more. Like in some of these sites, it's not very easy to see how much baggage you are allowed to take for free, or how much it costs to add luggage. So it would be nice to see, because that is can be a big change of price in the total amount. So I would like to see, ah, this will be a good idea, like I can check how much baggage I would like to travel with, like hand baggage or and also the dimensions of the language, and that will be added to the total price. That will actually be a really good feature

# **18. Would you be interested in testing prototypes and providing feedback on our design as it develops?**

Yes!
