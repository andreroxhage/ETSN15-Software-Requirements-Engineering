# Hello, thank you for participating in this interview.

Thank you so much for interviewing me.

# I'm going to have an open-ended interview with you. You can feel free to ask questions whenever you want, or if you want something to be clarified, just tell me. So we are developing a product called EasyTrip, and it will be used to compare flight prices.

That's nice.

# In order to make the product useful, we are conducting interviews to understand travelers' priorities. So feel free to ask anything, or if you want to add something to a prior question, you can also just interrupt me.

# Can you tell me a little bit about yourself, just some basic facts?

My name is Sofia. I'm a 24-year-old medical student who lives in Lund, originally from there as well. So I didn’t travel far.

# Do you travel often?

I would say so. I actually traveled for four months in Southeast Asia with my boyfriend. It was an amazing experience, and we used some flight apps that may be quite similar to what you are interested in making.

Should I tell more about myself?

# Yeah, I was actually going to ask you about traveling by air. How often do you think you travel by air, and for what purpose?

I only travel by air for holidays, and one time I traveled for work to attend a conference.

# Mostly for vacation, but one time for work?

Yeah, exactly. If it's very far away, then I take a flight. If it's in Sweden, Norway, or a nearby country, then I often take the train or car.

# How often do you think you travel by air? Is it like two times every year?

I would say about one or two times every year. But when I was traveling with my boyfriend for four months, we flew about seven times. So it depends, but usually around one to two times a year.

# I understand. When you are booking flights, what tools or services do you use?

I use Momondo, Skyscanner, and sometimes an app I can’t recall the name of right now, but it’s also a search engine.

# So you use Momondo or this other app to find flights, and then you book directly with the airline?

Yes. If I find a good price with Norwegian, for example, I go to Norwegian’s website to book it directly. It feels safer that way.

# So you first compare flights on Momondo or Skyscanner, and then book directly through the airline?

Exactly.

# Do you ever face any challenges when searching for flights? Any problems?

Sometimes, I don’t have to travel on an exact date, but searching for multiple dates is a hassle. I have to manually check different days, which takes time.

# You mean it would be helpful to choose a range of dates and have the app suggest the best price?

Yes. If I know I want to travel to Scotland for about a week but don’t have to leave on a specific day, it would be nice if an app suggested the best day based on price.

# So you’d like to choose an interval of days, and the app would tell you which day is the cheapest?

Yes. It doesn’t even have to be a fixed date; just a range, like "I want to travel for a week, give or take three days, starting around this time."

# I see. Let’s continue. How do you choose where to travel for a holiday?

Most often, I already have a place in mind—something I’ve heard about or seen. But sometimes, I look at a specific airline and check which destination has the lowest price.

# So sometimes destination is important, and sometimes price is the deciding factor?

Yes. If the price difference is huge, I may go for the cheaper option. But if the prices don’t vary much, I choose based on destination. If something is very expensive, I postpone it for later.

# So you might change the location based on price?

Exactly.

# You said price is a factor. On a scale from 1 to 10, how important is it?

That’s hard to say. Sometimes I know I want to go somewhere and will pay a lot for it. Other times, I look at prices for inspiration, which opens my mind to different destinations. If I see a cheap flight to Slovenia, for example, I might consider going.

# But if you had to rate price importance from 0 to 10?

I’d say around 4. It’s a factor, but not the most important.

# Are there any methods you use to find cheap destinations?

I use Momondo or Skyscanner and sort by the cheapest flight. But it’s also important that there aren’t too many layovers.

# That’s also a factor?

Yes. The total travel time matters too.

# If you compare Momondo, Hopper, and Skyscanner, do you have a favorite?

They’re quite similar. What I like is that Momondo and Hopper show a visual representation of price trends. You can see a curve of how prices change over time. Hopper also predicts if prices will increase or decrease and sends notifications.

# So Momondo has visual price trends, and Hopper has predictions and notifications?

Yes.

# Is there anything you dislike about these platforms?

Not really, but one issue is that you have to book with different airlines separately. It’s nice that they combine different flights, but you have to book them individually, which is an extra step.

# Would it be better if you could book everything in one place?

Yes, that would be great.

# Have you ever had a frustrating experience when booking a flight online?

Yes, sometimes flights get sold out while I’m filling out the form. Also, on some older websites, if you go back to change something, the information disappears, which is annoying.

# We touched on this earlier, but when comparing factors like price, departure time, layovers, and airline reputation, is there one that stands out?

Airline reputation isn’t that important to me because I feel like negative reviews are often from frustrated travelers who missed their flight. Departure time matters, but the total travel duration is more important.

# So total duration is a key factor?

Yes, exactly.
