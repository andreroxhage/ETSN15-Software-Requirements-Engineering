# Request for Participation in Short Survey for Academic Project

Hi,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is André Roxhage, and I am an engineering student and enrolled in the ETSN15 Requirements Engineering course at Lund University. As part of a project for this course, my team and I are developing a conceptual travel planning tool called EasyTrip, designed to enhance the way users compare and explore flight options.

To better understand user needs and expectations, we are reaching out to industry professionals and travelers for their input. We would appreciate it if someone from your team could take a few moments to answer a brief set of questions. Your insights will help us refine the requirements for our concept.

The questions are short and can be answered directly by replying to this email. However, if you have the possibility, we'd like to have a more in-depth meeting, to further investigate your needs as a stakeholder.

Here are some sample questions we would like to ask:

- What challenges do you commonly observe travelers facing when booking flights?
- Do you provide API endpoints to companies such as Momondo to fetch real-time data on your flight prices?
- How does such an agreement between Airline and e.g Momondo look like?
- How do you handle API rate limits or data throttling when sharing flight availability and prices?
- Do you have any specific requirements regarding how your flights, prices, or promotions are displayed on third-party sites?
- What are your requirements on the flight comparison websites that displays your data?
- Which features or tools do you think are most underutilized in current flight comparison systems?
- Anything else you'd like to add?

We would be happy to provide the complete list of questions upon your acceptance of this request.

If you are available to assist, please let us know. Your contributions will be acknowledged as part of our academic project, and any feedback will remain confidential and used strictly for educational purposes.

Thank you for considering our request. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need more information.

Best regards,  
André Roxhage
