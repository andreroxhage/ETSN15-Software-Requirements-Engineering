# **1. Can you tell us a little about yourself? (e.g., occupation, travel frequency, digital habits)**

I am a student. I live in Malmö. I have a partner. I work part-time in a store alongside my studies.

# **2. How often do you travel by air, and for what purposes (e.g., business, family visits, holiday)?**

I usually travel abroad during the summer, at least one trip. I typically go on a sun vacation in Europe once a year.  
For relaxation and vacation.  
On average, I take two trips a year, which means four flights.

# **3. What tools or services do you currently use to book flights?**

I usually check with Momondo, mainly Momondo.

# **4. Can you shortly describe your usual process when planning a trip?**

I start by checking flights on Momondo and then check accommodations on the computer. I compare back and forth to find the cheapest option. For example, if I find a flight today, but the accommodations are expensive or fully booked that week, I check flights for another week when the accommodations are cheaper. It’s an iterative process.

# **5. What are the biggest challenges you face when searching for flights?**

When booking through Momondo and being redirected to another website, the booking can sometimes fail, and the price increases when trying again. It’s also stressful to know that algorithms increase prices when you search for the same trip multiple times.

# **6. How do you know where to travel when deciding for a holiday?**

It depends on what we want. For example, if we want to surf, we check for good surf spots and good prices. Sometimes I ask friends for recommendations.

# **7. How important is the price of the transportation when deciding where to go? (on a scale [0,10])**

The price is important but not crucial. I don’t choose the destination based on flight prices, but I still try to find the cheapest flight.  
Within Europe, the flight price isn’t a major factor, but for long trips like to Australia, price plays a bigger role.  
On a scale from 0 to 10, maybe around 6 for trips within Europe.

# **8. Are there any methods for finding cheap destinations?**

Airlines sometimes promote cheap destinations on their own websites, but I don’t have a specific method for finding cheap destinations.

# **9. Which flight comparison websites or apps have you used? (e.g., Momondo, Google Flights, Skyscanner)**

I mostly use Momondo. Sometimes, I also check FlygResor.se.

# **10. What do you like and dislike about these platforms?**

I like that you get a good overview with price bars and a calendar. You can easily filter for direct flights, price, and time.  
Dislike: The price doesn’t always include baggage, and the functionality for including baggage rarely works correctly.

# **11. Have you ever encountered any frustrating experiences while booking a flight online?**

Yes, when we were going to Portugal, the booking didn’t go through the first time, and when I tried again, the price had increased. It wasn’t directly Momondo’s fault but the airline increasing the price.

# **12. How important are factors like price, departure time, layovers, and airline reputation when choosing a flight?**

- **Price:** Important but not the only factor.
- **Departure time:** I’m willing to adjust it to get a cheaper flight, but I often regret early flights once it’s time to travel.
- **Layovers:** I prefer to avoid long layovers and am willing to pay extra to avoid waiting 5 hours at an airport.
- **Airline reputation:** For short trips within Europe, I don’t care much about the airline. For long trips, like to the U.S., I chose SAS because it felt safer.

# **13. Do you ever use filters when searching for a trip? Do you usually enable notifications on price drops or similar features?**

Yes, I use filters for direct flights, a maximum of one layover, and checked baggage.  
I’ve never used notifications for price drops, but it could be useful if I were booking well in advance.

# **14. Do you usually book flights immediately after finding a good price, or do you monitor prices over time?**

I don’t usually book immediately. I check the available accommodations first. As a student, I’m often limited to traveling in August when many people are also traveling, so prices are often higher.

# **15. Do you find current flight comparison interfaces easy to use? Why or why not?**

Yes, they are straightforward to use. I like the price bars and how you can compare dates. But since I often have limited flexibility, I haven’t used price calendars much.

# **16. What kind of visual elements help you understand and compare flights more effectively?**

Price calendars and bar charts that show price differences across dates.

# **17. Is there anything else you would like to add about your experience with travel planning?**

As a student, I’m often limited to specific weeks when I can travel, which affects how much I can optimize for price.

# **18. Would you be interested in testing prototypes and providing feedback on our design as it develops?**

Sure!
