% (a) Description of your requirements engineering work, including experiences and reflections in relation to learning objectives.
% (b) Description of the chosen methods/techniques for elicitation, specification, validation, and prioritization.
% (c) Motivation for why you chose the used methods/techniques.
% (d) Reflection on the usage of these methods/techniques in terms of what
% was successful and what was challenging. Example questions for reflection: What have you learned in relation to the learning objectives in
% this course program? What would you have done differently based on
% what you know now? What have you learned in relation to the learning
% objectives?
% (e) Reflection on the interaction among internal and (potential) external
% stakeholders through the different steps of the Requirements Engineering process.
% (f) A personal statement by each team member that briefly explains each
% individual’s contributions to the project results (what) and the total
% number of hours of project work per person (how much).
% (g) The Project Experiences should not include course evaluation issues,
% but focus on your own work and learning outcome.
