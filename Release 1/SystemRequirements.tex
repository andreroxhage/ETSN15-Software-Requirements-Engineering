\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Naming convention}
The naming convention used for requirements are descriptive camelCase names for Functional, Quality and Data requirements.

\subsection{Context Diagram}
The context diagram (\autoref{fig:context-diagram}) illustrates the systems key stakeholders in the inner domain. This includes travellers, travel agencies, airlines, IT maintenance and ad providers. In the outer domain, the context diagram shows marketing platforms, Google Maps for displaying maps and advertisers.

\subsection{Business Goals}
The system should claim 20\% of the market share in the flight search market within the next 12 months. This will be done by differentiating the product from competitors and using unique data visualization. The system will gain a competitive advantage and attract customers from competitors and encourage them to fly more. The adaption of the product can be measured by tracking the number of new users in the system.
See \autoref{fig:mockup1} and \autoref{fig:mockup2} for a visual representation of the system.

The system should include features that improve customer satisfaction and loyalty, leading to 30\% of users coming back to visit the service at least once a month. The customer retention rates can be measured by user feedback and monitoring the flight search frequency by users.  

The system should support features that enable the business to reach new markets and customer segments. This includes users from a wide range of economic status, from those seeking budget-friendly flights to those interested in premium travel options. This will be done by providing unique visualization of flight prices that attracts more customers.


\section{Elicitation}
% Jonathan & André
% Describe the elicitation process, what went well, what could have been done better. Interview, 1-2 persons, interview guide, semistructural interview. Then summarize the results in the elixitaion.tex.
