\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Naming convention}
The naming convention used for requirements are the following. F1, Q1, D1, is short for Functional, Quality and Data requirements.
The overall goal of the system is to provide a platform for users to find cheap flights while driving revenue for the business and gain market share.

\subsection{Context Diagram}
The context diagram illustrates the systems key stakeholders in the inner domain. This includes travellers, travel agencies, airlines, IT maintenance and ad providers. In the outer domiain, the context diagram shows marketing platforms, Google Maps for diplaying maps and advertisers.

\subsection{Business Goals}
The system should help gain revenue by providing features that attract more customers and encourage existing customers to fly more. By differentiating the product from competitors, using unique data visualization, the system should be able to gain a competitive advantage. See figure 1 and 2 for a visual representation of the system.

The system should include features that improve customer satisfaction and loyalty, leading to higher customer retention rates.

The system should support features that enable the business to reach new markets and customer segments. This could include new types of users that not only want to find cheap flights, but also finds where they can travel for a certain budget.
