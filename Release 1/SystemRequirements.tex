\section{Introduction}
System Requirements include the following:
% System Requirements include the following:
% (a) Different types of system requirements, e.g. data, function, quality
% at different levels, e.g. goal, domain, product, design.
% (b) Several specification techniques, e.g. context diagrams, features,
% virtual windows, task descriptions.
% (c) Each requirement should have a unique identity (name or number). FQ1, Q1, D1,
% (d) A Release Plan should be part of R2 & R3, in which a subset of the
% requirements are prioritized and planned to be implemented in three
% imagined future product releases called R4, R5, R6.
% (e) Design-level requirements should be specified for the sub-set of requirements that are planned for a future imagined product release R4 - Jonathan & André
% (see 6e). This sub-set of requirements shall be implemented as mockup designs in R3 using, e.g. screens and prototypes, analog drawings, clickable presentations, executable GUI mockups or similar

\section{Elicitation}
% Jonathan & André
% Describe the elicitation process, what went well, what could have been done better. Interview, 1-2 persons, inteview guide, semistructural interview. Then summarize the results in the elixitaion.tex.

\section{Functional Requirements}
% Ossian
% Describe what the system does, i.e., the services it provides to the users.
\input{functionalRequirements.tex}

\section{Data / Non-Functional Requirements}
% Jacob & Felix
% Details about the data the system will handle, API's etc, data structure and aggregations
\input{dataRequirements.tex}

\section{Quality Requirements}
% Simon Persson
% Describe the quality attributes of the system, such as performance, usability, etc.
