## Feedback Supervision 31 Jan

no code needed!

send email to airlines people, for elicitations.
Need two types of stakeholders for higher grade (users, and ???)

continuesly write the reflections

### Project Mission - feedback

we frame it like we already know it will be a good idea.

Context diagram\_
family and friends. include in booking process features.
add Google Maps integration to the diagram.
no need for multiple airlines, since airlines is in plural.

### Release 1 - feedback

DONE! Elicitation: email details, how did the contact work, questions asked etc.

DONE! ElicitationReflection: Add subsections

DONE! Add Goal level requirements, "smell of money", before or after the introduction.

#### Function requirements:

maybe task desriptions for heatmap feature (our some main feature)
subsections for grouping different features.

Reconsider ID system: robust for document restructoring
F2,F4 product or domain level. Skip naming -P -D and instead write about the level in the requirement. No need to argue it just tell which level it is

F5, F9 are very similar. Elaborate so the difference is clear. If we make subsections it will be clearer separation
Map or heatmap, make sure to use consistent terminology

F21, F22 maybe they are product or feature level reqiurements, perhaps they are req on multiple levels

#### Data

Add DR1 to ER diagram
flight search - schedule (1-1)? rethink the cardinality

Vritual window missing ID as well. Needs more descruptions regarding the context of the windows, add text before the virtual window.

#### Quality

Remove the level from the name.
F17, more types of quality requirements. Security.
André can add usability requirement SUS scale, score above 50 and WCAG 2.1 standard.

#### Other things

DONE! Add text description before context diagram, add an id to it. Maybe move it to near intro if we decide to use it as a explaination to the system.

Release plan. Add text before table.

#### Project experience

Make sure to include

- a section with reflections about the whole project
  - project decisions, why did we chose the methods etc.
  - what took more or less time etc
- cover every single method use and a reflection for that
