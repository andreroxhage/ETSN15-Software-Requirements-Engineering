\subsection{Stakeholder Analysis}   
Our stakeholders are competitors like Momondo and Flight Scanner, travel agencies providing data partnerships, end users (travelers) providing feedback, product management and development teams, airline companies indirectly benefiting from bookings, and non-obvious actors such as the support department (Customer Experience). 

\subsubsection{Airlines}
We need information regarding API endpoints for fetching price, date and times, availabilty etc. for all their flights based on users search query. Agreements on business model regarding affiliate links that will be used to generate revenue.
...

What are their piece of this cake, risks, costs, etc. ? ? ? 
Our revenue is directly linked to agreements with airlines, as we will generate revenue through affiliate links. Since we also use ads as a part of our revenue, we distibute the risks in multiple areas.
The airlines will recieve a larger customer base, as we will be a marketing channel for them. Since they will proide us the required data for our system to work, there is a risk that they will not provide the data we need or that the data is not accurate. Since the airlines are our main source of data, we are dependent on them. This is a risk, as they can change their API or data structure, which would require us to make changes to our system. This would increase our costs. However, since we will use thousands of airlines as our data source, the risk is distributed.

Also, a risk is that the airlines will not agree on our business model, and abruptly end our partnership which scrutinizes our revenue.
