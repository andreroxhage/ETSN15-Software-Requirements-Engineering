\subsection{Data Requirements}

For the data requirements three methods were chosen. These methods were data model, data dictionary and virtual window. For this project one experience was that
making data requirements are more or less difficult depending on what part of the project is developed. The data requirements used were thus targeting the user
account system in the product as well as the search system for the flights. These are the crucial parts that are the most important to include in early releases.
Other areas such as the ad providers or how the data from airlines should be handled are harder to construct and a reason for this is a lack of knowledge in
how this data would be represented from thses sources, this would be improved over the release iterations in the project over time.

Another point that was explored was in which level the E/R-model was placed. Initially it was placed in the design level but since data requiremtns usually are similar
across the different levels it was chosen to be moved up to domain level instead in order to not interfere with the design level implementations.
