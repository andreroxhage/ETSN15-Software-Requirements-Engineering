\subsection{Context diagram}

\subsubsection{Experiences}
The context diagram was done by the whole group together during an exercise. We learned about this quick and useful elicition technique.
\subsubsection{Description of the method}
A context diagram was made to elicitate which stakeholders there are and what interactions can exist between actors and the product. The result is a drawing showing the product as a black box, actors and users that interact with eachother and the product. The inner and outer domain is defined by drawing a circle around actors that interact directly with the product.
\subsubsection{Why this method?}
The method helps to understand what actors and interactions exist around the product. Conflicts of interests between different stakeholders can also be found through this method. It also produces a diagram that can be presented to others as an overview over interactions and potential stakeholders in an understandable way. The diagram can be a useful reference for future discussion and can also be used as a requirement. The method takes relatively short time and can be done in an early state to get everyone involved on the same page. It gets people talking and misunderstandings can be sorted out early.
\subsubsection{How it was}
The technique showed us that we knew very little about what actors could be involved and how they would interact. It also showed us that we had different ideas about how things would work. We discovered for example that we didn’t know exactly how the product could generate revenue. After some discussion, we concluded that there will be two separate sources; ads and referrals to airline companies. 

We also had a healthy discussion about which actors were in direct contact with the product. We decided that travel agencies may want to use our product but that it would not be our main target user. It was also concluded that we should offer support and that they would be a stakeholder as well. 

One challenge we discovered was that the team was not unified on what entities or actors are supposed to be placed in a certain state. Such as if our ad platform was supposed to be inside or outside of the inner domain or if we want to support travel agencies as well as travellers to use our product or only travellers.

Overall we thought that the method used was very useful in an early stage for elicitation.
\subsubsection{What we would do differently}
What we recommend for others to do is firstly shorten down your thought process and focus on one aspect at a time. For example, firstly look at direct actors inside the inner domain, and then move on one step at a time to minimize risk of missing components or misplacing entities.



\subsection{Elicitation}
\subsubsection{Stakeholder Analysis}
The first and main elicitation made was the stakeholder analysis where we identified the stakeholders and their interests. This was done by brainstorming and discussing with the team during exercises in school. We later moved on letter two of the group members to write and deeply analyse the stakeholders.

\subsubsection{Traveller Interviews}
The second elicitation was of the stakeholder traveller where we interviewed two persons who travels frequently. This was done by two group members and the results were later summarised. We felt that it was a good way of getting a deeper understanding of the user and their needs. 

\subsubsection{Email Questions - Airlines and Travel Agencies}
The third elicitation was the sending of questions by email to the stakeholders airlines and travel agencies. This was done by two group members and the results were later summarised. Happiliy we got a response from one of the airlines, easyJet, which gave us some details but not as much as we hoped for. Although, we felt that the answers were still useful and validated reflections from the stakeholder analysis that was alreadty done. We did ask for a meeting but they declined.
