\subsection{Context diagram}

Firstly we created a context diagram from our understanding which we later discovered lacked important entities. This work broadened our knowledge of context diagram and view on work in requirements engineering. We discovered that we didn’t know exactly how the product could earn money. After some discussion we came to the conclusion that there will be two separate sources; ads and referrals to airline companies. We also had a healthy discussion about which actors were in direct contact with the product. We decided that travel agencies may want to use our product but that it would not be our main target user. It was also concluded that we should offer support and that they would be a stakeholder as well. 

From our discussions with our supervisor we learned that there are more stakeholders we need to take into consideration compared to what we previously had listed. This certainly helped the product develop even further and enhance its project description to formulate a clearer goal view. 

We decided to create a context diagram because of two main reasons, firstly it helps us create an architecture for the project that we can later use to describe our different features and relations. Secondly the technique helps narrow down what actors are involved with the product and who the stakeholders are.

One challenge we discovered was that the team was not unified on what entities or actors are supposed to be placed in a certain state. Such as that our ad provider is supposed to be inside or outside of the inner domain.

What we recommend for others to do is firstly shorten down your thought process and focus on one aspect at a time. For example, firstly look at direct actors inside the inner domain, and then move on one step at a time to minimize risk of missing components or misplacing entities.

Overall we thought that the method used was very useful in an early stage for elicitation, requirement generation and to get everyone involved on the same page.
