    F1 & Q1-P & Search results should be displayed within 2 seconds for a standard query. & Tested by generating random inputs and measuring response time using automated performance testing tools, logging response times for 1000+ random queries. & If too slow, users may switch to competitors. \\
    \hline
    F2 & Q2-D & The system should support flexible date ranges spanning at least 30 days for price comparisons. & Test by selecting a range of 30-60 days, verifying the system returns results across all days without errors. & To be added \\
    \hline
    F3 & Q3-D & Location detection should be completed in under 3 seconds with at least 95\% accuracy. & Use GPS data from 50 ore more test cases across different devices and measure accuracy based on expected vs. detected locations. & To be added \\
    \hline
    F4 & Q4-P & The system should retrieve and display flight prices within 2 seconds for a standard query. & Execute automated tests simulating 1000+ searches and log the response time until results are fully rendered. Primarily same as Q1-P & To be added \\
    \hline
    F5 & Q5-P & The list should support sorting by price, duration, and airline, with sorting applied in under 1 second. & Use UI performance tests to time sorting actions on datasets of varying sizes for example destinations with a lot of flights or destinations with less flights. & To be added \\
    \hline
    F6 & Q6-P & The system should allow searching for up to 10 passengers simultaneously without affecting response time. & Compare response times of searches with 1 vs. 10 passengers under normal and peak loads. & To be added \\
    \hline
    F7 & Q7-D & The heatmap should update dynamically within 3 seconds of data input or changes. & Time updates after input changes for example destination, price range or starting point across different devices.  & To be added \\
    \hline
    F8 & Q8-D & The map should reflect date changes in under 2 seconds without requiring a full reload. & Monitor UI logs to confirm rendering completion time after date modifications. & To be added \\
    \hline
    F9 & Q9-P & Destination lists should be updated in real-time when new flight deals become available. & Insert a new deal in the back-end or get deal from airlines API and verify update propagation within milliseconds. & To be added \\
    \hline
    F10 & Q10-P & Clicking a flight should navigate to the booking page within 1 second and fill in relevant details from users account. & Use automated UI testing to time redirection and fill in data according to users account. & To be added \\
    \hline
    F11 & Q11-P & Selected airports should be highlighted instantly and search results updated in under 2 seconds. & Measure UI update times via browser dev tools or performance logs. & To be added \\
    \hline
    F12 & Q12-P & The system should retrieve multi-flight prices in less than 5 seconds, considering layovers and airlines. & Run tests for complex multi-leg searches, logging response times for different scenarios. & To be added \\
    \hline
    F13 & Q13-G & Travel agency accounts should support handling at least 50 concurrent searches without slowdown. & Simulate 50+ concurrent users with load-testing tools for example JMeter and measure system response time. & To be added \\
    \hline
    F14 & Q14-D & The registration process should take no longer than 15 seconds, including email verification. & Automate user sign-ups and measure time from form submission to receiving the verification email. & To be added \\
    \hline
    F15 & Q15-D & Email verification links should be sent within 5 seconds and expire after 24 hours. & Log email dispatch times in the system and verify expiration behavior after 24 hours. & To be added \\
    \hline
    F16 & Q16-P & Changes to email addresses should be confirmed within 10 seconds via a verification email. & Track the end-to-end time from submission of email change request to email receipt. & To be added \\
    \hline
    F17 & Q17-P & Password changes should be effective after 5 seconds and require strong passwords (at least 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, symbol). & Verify enforcement of password complexity rules and Ensure old credentials become invalid 5 seconds after post-update. & To be added \\
    \hline
    F18 & Q18-P & Reset emails should be sent within 10 seconds and expire after 30 minutes. & Log email dispatch times and attempt password resets after 30 minutes to confirm expiration. & To be added \\
    \hline
    F19 & Q19-D & Marketing email preferences should be configurable and updated in real-time. & Toggle marketing settings in the Account management section and verify backend logs reflect changes 5 seconds. & To be added \\
    \hline
    F20 & Q20-P & Favorite cities should be stored 5 seconds and retrievable in under 1 second. & Save favorite cities and time retrieval speed via API performance monitoring. & To be added \\
    \hline
    F21 & Q21-G & Reports should be generated in under 10 seconds for a dataset covering the last 6 months. & Execute test report requests and measure query execution and rendering time. & To be added \\
    \hline
    F22 & Q22-P & Marketing emails should be delivered to 95\% of recipients within 1 minute of sending. & Track email delivery timestamps for mass campaigns and compute success rate over time. & To be added \\
