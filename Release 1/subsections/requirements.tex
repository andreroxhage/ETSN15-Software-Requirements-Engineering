In the following subsections, we will go through each functional requirement and the quality requirements associated with it. The main focus will be to achieve a minimal viable product that satisfies the functional requirements while meeting the quality requirements. The reason for this is that we want to be able to release the product as soon as possible and then iterate on it. Therefor we strive to balance technical feasibility, user experience, security, and other quality characteristics.

The requirements in this document follow a hierarchical structure where indented requirements represent data or quality requirements that are connected to their parent functional requirement. This structure helps show the relationships between functional requirements and their associated quality attributes or data specifications.

For example, a functional requirement like \textbf{HeatmapSearch} may have indented quality requirements such as \textbf{HeatmapPerformance} that specify performance criteria for that feature.

\subsection*{Quality Grid Explanations}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item It is critical that the system is always available since it can be used by anyone across the world, meaning we have the potential to gain customers at any time of the day. If availability is below 99\%, the company loses money, and key stakeholders, such as airlines, are negatively impacted.
    \item If the system cannot filter or return proper search results quickly, users may grow impatient and leave for a competitor.
    \item The system must be easy to navigate and use since our customer base includes anyone willing to travel. Users will have a wide range of experience using websites. Since our differentiation lies in ease of learning we deem it critical that the usability and ease of learning needs to meet our quality requirements.
    \item The system is not required to interact with other systems like file transfers or specific hardware. However, some components need to cooperate with external systems, such as our ad provider or direct links to airlines for flight booking.
    \item Since the system is web-based on computer workstations, installation is unnecessary. However, for the mobile version, an app must be installed, which should be easy to download from platforms like the App Store or Google Play.
