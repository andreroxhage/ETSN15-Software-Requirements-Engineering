\section{Background, purpose and goals}
\subsection{Background}
The travel industry is a large and competetive sector with many different actors.
The market is dominated by a few large companies,
which makes it hard for smaller companies to compete.
In the recent years,
services like Momondo and Flight Scanner have gained popularity by offering a service that compares prices from different airlines.
This has made it easier for customers to find the best prices for their flights.
However, these services are not perfect and there is still room for improvement. 

In this project, we will develop a new service called EasyTrip. The goal of EasyTrip is to provice a better service than the existing ones. We will do this by offering a more user-friendly and interactive interface, as well as by providing accurate and up-to-date information. By chosing a starting point, we will compare and visualize flight prices using a map. This will make it easier for the user to find the best prices for their flights, while also exploring new destinations.

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this product is to provide an easy-to-use travel planning tool that enhances customer satisfaction by comparing flight prices efficiently across different geographic areas.

\subsection{Business Goals}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Increase market share by competing with established platforms like Momondo and Flight Scanner.
    \item Generate revenue through partnerships with travel agencies and ad placements.
    \item Build a user base of travelers who trust the platform for accurate price comparisons.
\end{itemize}
